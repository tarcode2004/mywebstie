									<b>Data Collection and Methods</b>
									<br/>
									In order to identify whether availability is the most significant factor holding AI back from widespread adoption and whether AI as a service is the solution 
									to these factors, qualitative research was conducted through interviews to learn the opinions of experts. Interviews were conducted with AI experts and 
									Ph.D. students. Questions were asked about how current AI technologies are being utilized, the weaknesses and strengths of AI, why the technology is not being
									 used more, and how people can make sure this technology is used in more applications.

									  interviewees indicated that there is a black box issue with AI limiting trust, and that the social impact of implementing this technology must be extensively
									   considered.

									  Figure 5 indicates that all the Interviewees believe AI as a Service will have a large impact on the adoption of AI, and most people and companies will use 
									  one form of AI as a service. And all interviewees indicated that the needs of businesses and individuals may not be provided by AI as a service, and even if 
									  they are they will need a lot of customization and implementation. One interviewee indicated that one reason people may not use AI as a service may be due to
										security reasons as a company may not want to share their data with others. For that reason many larger companies will either assemble their own AI groups or
									    invest in/acquire private groups researching and developing AI. Another solution to availability are application source interfaces which allows different 
										apps and programs to communicate with each other and open source code. Dr. Chen said that people can use open source software and modularize parts of the 
										technology. Tasks like object recognition can be modularized but someone has to put the parts together, train the system, and tweak it for the applications. 
										Dr. Gani suggested that sensing APIs can be used and Dr. Wang said robotics technologies can be implemented with assistants like google assistant or alexa. 
										Essentially developers and researchers can use existing technologies to build their own technology. As Dr. Wang put it, developing everything yourself is not 
										wise.

										<br> <br>
										<b>Discussion/Conclusion</b>

										<p>The research partially supported the hypothesis. As seen in figure 4, while cost and availability are major factors holding back the adoption of AI and AI as a 
										service will have a great impact on the adoption of AI (Figure 5) as my hypothesis stated, AI as a service still requires experts and a lot of resources. And for 
										many applications AI as a Service will not suffice and many might not want to share their data. Beyond availability and cost there are many limitations of AI. As 
										seen in figure 2, AI has a transparency issue, a transparency/ethics/bias issue, a lack of understanding of causality, deficiencies in planning, decision making, 
										emotion, creativity, collaboration, and the lack of the ability to carry over experience from one task to another. Similarly, as shown in figure 3 some of the 
										leading factors holding AI back are that current AI cannot solve all problems, there is a lack of trust, and there is a lack of maturity requiring more time and 
										development. The literature review pointed to the issue of transparency, lack of efficiency, lack of availability but not the limited capability like the lack of 
										understanding of causality and the ability to carry over experience, which are massive roadblocks in the future of AI. </p>
		
										<p>This study was only conducted on four AI experts all who work at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. Researchers at other institutions may have different
										 opinions. This study and research can be redone with a greater and more diverse audience. The issues of transparency, the black box issue, public trust in AI, bias 
										 in AI, AI understanding of causality, AI transferring experience from one task to another, and measuring efficiency, and making AI more available and easier and 
										 cheaper for individuals and small organizations are all topics that can and should be further investigated.</p>
